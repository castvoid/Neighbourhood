<h1>Browser Not Supported :(</h1>
<p>
Hello,<br /><br />
Thank you for visiting Neighbourhood. I am afraid that your browser is not supported by this website,<br />
because we want all users to have an equal and pleasant experience we have taken the decision to redirect you to this page.<br />
If you would like to view the website you will be required to update your internet browser. <br />
This is usually a very easy thing to do and almost always free.

I reccomend that you use Mozilla Firefox although Google Chrome is also excellent.<br  />
If you do like Microsoft Internet Explorer then you may update to IE 9 <br />
(although you may experience a few small problems).
<br /><br />
Upgrade <a href="http://browsehappy.com/">here</a>.
